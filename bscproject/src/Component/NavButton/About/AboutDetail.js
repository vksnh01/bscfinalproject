              One of the oldest colleges started teaching in Saharanpur district

              In the early fifties there were no colleges to teach agriculture
              in Saharanpur district of western Uttar Pradesh. Most people of
              Western Uttar Pradesh were socio economically backward due to poor
              higher educational status. However, some of the rich people were
              used to going far off places to obtain their higher education.
              Chaudhary Multan Singh, an eminent Socialist & Educationalist
              started Gurjar Degree College in Rampur Maniharan district
              Saharanpur (UP) in 1959 with an objective to provide higher
              education in Agriculture and Science. The college has been
              affiliated to Chaudhary Charan Singh University, Meerut (UP).
              Later, during the 1970s the name of the college was changed as
              Gochar Mahavidyalaya. Though the college has started to teach
              B.Sc. (Ag), presently apart from B.Sc. (Ag), the college is
              running courses viz., faculty of Arts, Science, Physical
              Education, Commerce, Management, Education, Home Science and BTC,
              etc. During 1988 the college was upgraded as Post Graduate College
              with the PG courses of teaching and research in M.Sc (Ag)
              Chemistry, Agriculture Botany and Horticulture.
